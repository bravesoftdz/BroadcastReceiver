Android Broadcast Receiver
==========================

###Disclaimer

This unit is the code for an Android Broadcast Receiver. 
Allows you to catch Intent notifications.

The work in this unit is to be credited to its author, as I had no participation in it.
I have found this unit in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34898950/how-read-jpendingintent-in-delphi), in an answer by user [@alitrun](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6705737/alitrun).
I tried to find it elsewhere, to no avail.

This git repository tries to facilitate the use of this code, assumed to be open source since it is published as an answer.
I do not, however, know this specific license agreement the author of this code intents it to be.
So every question about the licensing of the code must be redirected to its author, which I assume is the mentioned SO user.


###To the author
If you are the author of this code, please let me know if this repository is in agreement with your will.
